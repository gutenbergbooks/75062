<h1>THE CATSPAW OF PIPEROCK</h1>

<div class='tac mb10'>By W. C. Tuttle</div>

<blockquote>
Ike Harper and Dirty Shirt Jones return in a hilarious story of the Christmas Season
</blockquote>

<p>Dirty Shirt Jones and Scenery Sims got religion. That in itself ain’t
of much interest, unless you knew these two. I’ve knowed lots of men who
got religion jist like Dirty Shirt and Scenery got it. Remorse, that’s
what she was&mdash;not religion. Too much liquor on an empty stummick.
I’ve felt the error of my ways from the same cause.</p>

<p>Dirty Shirt Jones wasn’t very big. His face was kinda antegodlin’,
and one eye sorta roamed around indefinite-like, usually comin’ to rest
with the pupil lookin’ down the length of his nose, as though amazed at
the crookedness of said organ. Dirty Shirt had some quaint ideas of
humor, and as far back as I can remember, he’s harbored a deadly hatred
against the towns of Yaller Horse and Paradise. Bein’ a loyal Piperocker
he couldn’t do otherwise.</p>

<p>Scenery Sims is smaller than Dirty Shirt. He’s a hard little devil,
this here Scenery Sims, almost bald, square above the ears, with eyes
like a pair of faded shoe buttons, one flarin’ ear&mdash;and a sense of
loyalty to Piperock.</p>

<p>It’s December in Piperock. There’s only one tree between Piperock and
the North Pole, which don’t noways temper the wind to the shorn lamb.
Piperock ain’t no metropolis&mdash;but, gentlemen, she’s a town. We sink
or swim, live or die, survive or perish together. As Magpie Simpkins
says, “We’re one and indigestible.”</p>

<p>Me and Dirty Shirt have been tryin’ to wrest some wealth from the
bosom of Mother Nature on the headwaters of Plenty Stone Creek, but the
weather drove us back to the fleshpots, where we’re doomed to spend the
rest of the winter. I’ve been spendin’ two days against a stove, tryin’
to git some heat inside my frozen carcass. When I does pilgrim uptown, I
finds old Dirty Shirt settin’ on the sidewalk in front of Buck
Masterson’s saloon. He’s humped up there, with his old mackinaw collar
above his ears, hands shoved down inside his old yaller angora chaps,
settin’ there in the snow, the thermometer below zero&mdash;and right
behind him is the saloon, where boot heels are sizzlin’ against the old
base burner, and water gittin’ hot for the next round of drinks.</p>

<hr>

<p>Magpie had told me that Dirty and Scenery were paralyzed drunk the
day before, and I had a hunch that Dirty had froze to death. But he
wasn’t dead. His active eye does a few loops, steadies down to a
strained contemplation of that crooked nose, and he says to
me&mdash;</p>

<p>“The way of the transgressor is pretty damn’ tough, Ike Harper.”</p>

<p>“All depends on how heavy your underclothes are,” says I. “How about
a shot of hot liquor?”</p>

<p>“Strong drink is ragin’, Ike.”</p>

<p>“So’s the thermometer.”</p>

<p>“I’m repentin’ of my sins.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve shore got a long hard season ahead of you, Dirty Shirt.
Where does it hurt you worst? You ain’t done got religion, have
you?”</p>

<p>“My sins are heavy among me, Ike. I’ve shot and slashed and cut and
cussed pretty much all m’ life.”</p>

<p>“Not countin’ horse and cattle stealin’, card markin’ and other forms
of malignant sins,” I reminds him. “But freezin’ to death ain’t goin’ to
wipe ’em out none to speak about. Why not try goin’ to the penitentiary
for life?”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t pay me out, Ike; I’m half through livin’ right now. Me and
Scenery got it together. He’s repentin’ in sackcloth and ashes right
now.”</p>

<p>“Yea-a-ah&mdash;but I’ll bet he ain’t sucker enough to freeze along
with ’em.”</p>

<p>“Old Testament Tilton told us&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You ain’t takin’ his word for it, are you, Dirty?”</p>

<p>“He’s our preacher, ain’t he? Me and Scenery went to church.”</p>

<p>“How in hell did anybody ever git you two in church?”</p>

<p>Dirty’s eye wobbles a lot, but pretty soon she jerks back to
attention.</p>

<p>“They ain’t got no bell,” he says kinda sad-like. “No bell on the
church. Don’tcha know it’s a shame&mdash;no bell on the church. Fact of
the matter is, it don’t look like no church. It’s a shame for a place to
not even look like a church. I tell you I’m goin’ to do somethin’ for
that church. I’m goin’ to fix her up so she’ll look and sound like a
church.”</p>

<p>“What’ll you use for money?” I asks.</p>

<p>“I’ll sell my horseless carriage to the highest bidder.”</p>

<p>I laughs through my chatterin’ teeth.</p>

<p>“Scenery might sell his camel,” says I, merely as a suggestion.</p>

<p>That camel was always a sore spot with Dirty Shirt. Him and Scenery
owned a placer mine back on Dog Town Creek, and they cleaned up about
fifteen hundred dollars, before the little pay streak played out. Durin’
that time, Dirty discovered a stretch of pretty good lookin’ quartz, and
him and Scenery decides to work it. They needed machinery; so Scenery
takes his share of the money and heads for Butte to buy the
machinery.</p>

<p>In about a week he shows up, half drunk, leadin’ a moth-eaten camel.
It seems that he got drunk in Butte, got in an argument with a feller
over how long a camel could go without drinkin’, bought a camel from a
travelin’ carnival and came back to prove he was right.</p>

<p>Naturally, Dirty Shirt got awful mad. He busted up his partnership
with poor Scenery, bought Scenery out for fifty dollars, and went to
Butte himself to get the machinery. And then he came back, trailin’ an
old automobile behind a pair of misbegotten mules. He had got drunk,
bought six hundred dollars’ worth of chances on a raffle&mdash;and won
the danged thing.</p>

<p>It was the second automobile to ever come to Piperock, and a
vigilance committee waited on Dirty Shirt right away; so Dirty stored it
in the Piperock Livery Stable, where it couldn’t scare anythin’. Scenery
kept his camel out at his shack, and put a warnin’ on the gate, which
read:</p>

<div class='tac mt05 mb05'>
BEWAIR THE CAMUEL<br>
THE DAMN THING BIGHTS.
</div>

<p>Scenery called it Araby. The danged thing smelt like a street in
Frisco Chinatown, and it would bite. Acted most of the time as though it
had a bad bellyache. The vigilance committee also warned Scenery to keep
his menagerie off the main roads, ’cause every bronc that saw it throwed
a fit and its rider at the same time.</p>

<p>Anyway, Dirty Shirt wouldn’t come in out of the cold; so I left him
there and went into Buck’s place, where I finds Magpie Simpkins, Buck
Masterson, Wick Smith and Old Testament Tilton, all settin’ around the
old stove. While Old Testament is our minister, he’s broad minded, six
feet six inches tall, and no man ever had a more “if I die right now you
won’t hear a squawk out of me” expression on his face. Accordin’ to him,
there ain’t no livin’ man knows more about hell. Magpie says Old
Testament will prob’ly git a job as a guide down there, after he’s
dead.</p>

<hr>

<p>Magpie Simpkins is and has been my pardner for years. He’s as tall as
Testament, wears a flowin’ mustache, and is a livin’ example of a man
who never did mind his own business. He thinks his mission in life is to
elevate humanity. His brain is filled with wonderful ideas, but each and
every one is shy some sort of a dingus that makes ’em tick. But he’ll
back any of his ideas with a six-gun or a neck yoke, when all else
fails.</p>

<p>Wick Smith is a retired killer. He still retains the disposition,
plus a walrus mustache and some bunions. He runs the Piperock
Merchandise Company, and agrees with his wife, who scales two hundred
and sixty. Buck Masterson was suspected of many things, before he
settled down to runnin’ a saloon. He ain’t so tall, but he’s got plenty
waist, big shoulders and skinny legs. On the Fourth of July he wears a
collar, and on Christmas he adds a necktie to same.</p>

<p>Them four pelicans is plannin’ somethin’, I can see that right away;
so I backed out and went home. I’m scared of them fellers, and when they
git to plannin’ anythin’ I want to be outside their plans. Magpie didn’t
say nothin’ when he came home, but he’s got somethin’ on his mind, and I
seen him sneakin’ a few peeks at a little black book.</p>

<p>“Whatcha got there?” I asks, but he don’t answer.</p>

<p>But I sneaked it out of his overalls pocket that night, and it’s a
Bible. I’ve knowed Magpie to have most everything else, but this is his
first time to pack a Bible. I didn’t say anythin’, but I got all set to
listen to mornin’ prayers. Mebbe he wasn’t that far gone, ’cause he
didn’t pray, but he did mention that fact that Dirty Shirt Jones had
turned over a new leaf and bid fair to become a valuable citizen of
Piperock.</p>

<p>It was the followin’ mornin’ after that, when I went up to Buck’s
place. I knowed I had twenty dollars in my pocket; so I invited those
present to partake with me, which they did with cold weather alacrity,
as you might say. Magpie was one of the elect. But when I dug deep for
my twenty, my gropin’ hand encounters a lot of hunks of cardboard.</p>

<p>I took out a handful and looked ’em over. They’re about two inches
square, with a pen and ink number on one side, and on the other is
written:</p>

<p>Good for one chance.</p>

<p>I dug once more, but there ain’t no money in my pocket. Buck looks at
me kinda dumb-like, and I says softly&mdash;</p>

<p>“Charge this up to me, Buck&mdash;until after the funeral.”</p>

<p>“No hurry,” says he.</p>

<p>I counted them tickets, and I’ve got twenty. Magpie smoothes his
mustache and watches me in the back bar mirror. Then he clears his
throat and says&mdash;</p>

<p>“It’ll be somethin’ we’ll all date time from, gents.”</p>

<p>“To me,” says I, “it’ll be jist a justified killin’, you long geared
pickpocket. You took that twenty out of my pocket and put in them
numbered cards.”</p>

<p>“Blessed be the meek,” says Old Testament.</p>

<p>“Meek be damned! I want my money. What are these chances on,
anyway?”</p>

<p>“Scenery Sims’ autymobile,” says Buck. “It cost a thousand, new. If
you can win it for twenty dollars&mdash;”</p>

<p>I blowed right up, but Wick Smith cramped my gun hand and tried to
explain:</p>

<p>“It’s to build a new church and buy a bell. It means advancement for
Piperock. Here’s Old Testament, grown as gray as a jackrabbit, tryin’ to
chase the devil away from us. He’s been a long laborer in the vineyard
of the Lord, and we’ve got to show our appreciation. Our church don’t
look like a church. There ain’t no bell. Your twenty will do more good
where it is right now than over Buck’s bar.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to git so damn’ enthusiastic,” growled Buck. “I’ve
gotta live, ain’t I?”</p>

<p>“That’s all fine,” says I, “but I don’t never go to church. I’m
master of my own soul, and I don’t need no sky pilotin’. I wouldn’t give
twenty dollars to that church, even if they’d give me Testament’s hide
and taller as a bonus. And that was the only twenty dollars I had
left.”</p>

<p>“It is better to give than to receive,” says Testament. “Just
remember that Dirty Shirt is donatin’ that autymobile, free gratis for
nothin’. There’s a lot of tickets bein’ sold in Paradise and Yaller
Horse, and the grand drawin’ is to be held at the Mint Hall on Christmas
Eve. We’re goin’ to give the best entertainment that’s ever been given
in this country.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” says I. “I won’t be here.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be here,” says Magpie. “As one of the local donators, you’ll
be here to see that it’s a success.”</p>

<hr>

<p>I walked out of there and went down to Dirty’s shack, where I found
Dirty and Scenery. They’ve got a bottle and a warm fire.</p>

<p>“How’s religion?” I asks, as I imbibes about the full of a mule’s
ear.</p>

<p>“To’able,” says Scenery. “Day after t’morrow is Christmas, usually
spelled with an X. Know why they spell it thataway, Ike? The X marks
where the body fell. Me and Dirty Shirt are gettin’ organized.”</p>

<p>“I thought you fellers had religion.”</p>

<p>“We did have,” nods Dirty.</p>

<p>“Oh, we need a reg’lar church,” says Scenery. “We need one that you
can see and recognize. That danged church we’ve got now looks like a
saloon. I’ll leave it to you, if it don’t. We need one with a
belfry.”</p>

<p>“We do,” agrees Dirty. “Oh, we shore do. The present one is a shame
and a disgrace. I’m doin’ my part, ain’t I? They’re rafflin’ off my
autymobile.”</p>

<p>“Will the danged thing run?” I asks.</p>

<p>“Shore will. It’s got gas’line in her, and all you’ve got to do is
twist the crank. Run? My Gawd, that thing’ll rear right up and paw the
sky. Stands me five hundred on the hoof right now. They’re goin’ to put
planks on the Mint Hall stairs and run her into the hall, where all may
gaze upon same.”</p>

<p>“And I’ve donated Araby,” says Scenery, grabbin’ for the bottle.</p>

<p>“They ain’t goin’ to raffle that thing, are they?”</p>

<p>“They shore ain’t! Raffle Araby? Huh! Nossir, they ain’t. I dunno
what they want Araby for, but I’ve done made the loan to Magpie and
Testament. I reckon the camule is part of the entertainment. I hope he
don’t eat an arm off somebody&mdash;unless they’re from Yaller Horse or
Paradise.”</p>

<hr>

<p>I stayed all night with them two public spirited men, and the next
day I’m so filled with remorse that I almost got religion. Along about
midnight Dirty went out to git some wood, forgot to shut the door, when
he came back, and when I woke up in the mornin’ I had one frozen
ear.</p>

<p>I asked Magpie what the performance was to be, and he asked me if I
knew what Christmas was all about. I said it was a time when folks
traded shirts, as far as I could understand. He said for me to attend,
and I’d learn what it was about. I told him I thought I would, bein’ as
it had already cost me twenty dollars. I went down to Paradise that
afternoon, and almost froze my other ear. Paradise town is about the
same size as Piperock, but if all their morals were laid end to end
you’d have to use calipers and a magnifyin’ glass to measure ’em.</p>

<p>I finds Tombstone Todd, Hair Oil Heppner and Hip Shot Harris over
from Yaller Horse, and if there ever was an unholy trinity, these are
it. Tombstone tries to question me a lot about our festivities, but I
don’t respond very much, ’cause I don’t know enough about it myself.</p>

<p>“Peace on earth!” snorts Hip Shot. “Good will toward men! Does that
mean men from Piperock? I’d crave to know about it, that’s what I’d
crave?”</p>

<p>“It means <em>men</em>,” says Hair Oil. “That natcherally cuts out
critters from Piperock. I heard the same thing, Hip Shot. Magpie
Simpkins and his misguided cohorts aim to kinda soft soap us fellers. I
know him of old. His dove of peace usually turns out to be a chicken
hawk. I won’t go up there at no danged Christmas time.”</p>

<p>“Piperock will be glad about that,” says I. “They sent me down here
to find out how many of you ain’t comin’. I’ll mark Hair Oil off my
list.”</p>

<p>“Mark me off, too,” says Hip Shot.</p>

<p>“You’re off. How about you, Tombstone?”</p>

<p>“I’m comin’. Like a danged fool I bought ten tickets on that raffle,
and I attends to see that no skulduggery is practiced.”</p>

<p>“If you ain’t there, your tickets ain’t legal.”</p>

<p>“Mark me back on,” says Hair Oil and Hip Shot together.</p>

<p>“There’s bound to be skulduggery,” adds Hair Oil. “I p’tects my
dollar.”</p>

<p>Over at Hank Padden’s saloon I finds ’em playin’ poker, usin’ tickets
as legal tender, and only bein’ discounted fifty per cent. I got into
that game and lost nineteen tickets on the first jackpot. I’d have lost
twenty, but I’d misplaced one of ’em, and didn’t find it until I was
halfway home. Old Tombstone Todd won ’em all from me.</p>

<p>Paradise has always wanted that autymobile, and as far as I can see,
most of the town are comin’ up to our shindig. Paradise can’t get along
together well enough to ever pull off a celebration; so they’ve got to
git outside their own limits, if they ever want entertainment.</p>

<hr>

<p>I didn’t go uptown that evenin’, but stayed at our shack. Magpie
wasn’t at home, and I knew he was as busy as a rat-tail bronc in fly
time. He’s always the movin’ spirit in Piperock, and up to the present
time, I’m the sacrificial goat that you read about in the Bible. But not
this time. For once in his life Ike Harper, Esquire, is goin’ to set
back and let somebody else be the burnt offerin’.</p>

<p>About nine o’clock that night Dirty Shirt comes down to my cabin.</p>

<p>“Do you want to re’lize on them tickets you got, Ike?” he asks.
“We’ve plumb run out of cardboard, and the market is good in Paradise. I
can git you jist what you paid.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ride on what I’ve got,” says I, kickin’ myself for that poker
game. “I may win that machine myself.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a danged fool, Ike. It ain’t got no brakes. Why, the whole
thing is loose. Anyway, you can’t run it around here. Let Paradise or
Yaller Horse have it. They won’t live long enough to enjoy it much.”</p>

<p>Then I told him about the poker game. I’d found the other ticket, but
one ticket wasn’t worth botherin’ about.</p>

<p>“You’re the only person in Piperock who has a ticket; so I reckon the
town is safe for democracy. We’ve done collected enough to build the new
church, and the admission fees will hang a bell on her.”</p>

<p>“Why are you and Scenery Sims so interested in havin’ a new
church?”</p>

<p>“The other one is a disgrace, Ike; it looks like a saloon. Well, I’ve
got to go back and rehearse.”</p>

<p>“Rehearse?”</p>

<p>“Shore. I’m one of the Three Wise Men.”</p>

<p>“Who’r the other two?”</p>

<p>“Magpie and Tellurium Woods.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, you better go back and rehearse, Dirty Shirt. You three
jiggers will shore need a lot of rehearsin’ for a job like that.”</p>

<p>“The Cross J quartette will sing. And Bill Thatcher’s orchestry will
render plenty.”</p>

<p>“Well, that isn’t anythin’ to git excited about. There’s a lot of
things I’d rather hear than Telescope Tolliver, Muley Bowles, Chuck
Warner and Henry Clay Peck singin’. They’re awful, but they ain’t as bad
as Thatcher’s orchestra, accordion, bull fiddle and a jew’s-harp,
playin’ ‘Sweet Marie’. I ain’t finicky about m’ music either.”</p>

<p>“The rest of it’ll be good, Ike. It’s a specktickle. Livin’ pitchers,
as you might say. Well, I’ve got to go back. We’re puttin’ the
autymobile up into the Mint Hall, and we’ve got to cut out the side of
the wall at the top of the stairs. We’ll elevate the machine up on a
couple saw horses, where everybody can look her over. Goin’ to run her
up on planks, with a block and fall.”</p>

<p>It shore was a good lookin’ machine, all fancy with shiny paint and
brass dinguses. We never had but one other machine in Piperock, and
somebody put dynamite under that one. Yaller Rock County is a horse
country.</p>

<p>I don’t reckon that machine would do very well in Paradise. But them
Paradise and Yaller Horse folks will buy raffle chances on anythin’.
They are so danged crooked themselves that they think Piperock is goin’
to pull a crooked deal on the raffle. And me with the only ticket in
Piperock! I don’t know what the odds are against me, but if they’ve
already got enough money to build the new church, them Paradisers and
Yaller Horses has shore dug deep in the old sock. But it’s all right
with me&mdash;I’m lookin’ for competition. I don’t want the danged
machine. I’ve got a horse and a burro, and that’s plenty rollin’ stock
for one man in my position. I ain’t even goin’ to the entertainment. I’m
goin’ to stand Buck off for a couple quarts and spend a quiet evenin’
beside my own fire.</p>

<hr>

<p>Well, I got the couple quarts all right, and I packed plenty wood
into the old shack for the evenin’. Then I put my gun on the table
beside me, declared plenty peace on earth, good will toward all men, and
settled down to enjoy life. Once in a while I can hear a few shots fired
uptown, but nothin’ to speak about. Christmas is usually quiet thataway,
and mostly always it’s so danged bitter cold that it freezes up the
grease in a six-gun so badly that you can’t shoot it outdoors. Most of
our killin’s are done indoors durin’ the winter months.</p>

<p>I’m setting there by the fire, kinda dreamin’, when all to once the
door flies open and there is Magpie and Tellurium.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas,” says Tellurium. “Git on your hat, Ike.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wear no hat in the house,” says I, reachin’ for my gun, but
Magpie beat me to it. Without that gun, I’m outnumbered.</p>

<p>“Here’s the whole thing in a nutshell, Ike,” says Magpie. “Wick Smith
fell down the chimbley durin’ rehearsal a while ago, and he busted his
collarbone. You’re the only man who can take his place on short notice.
Git your hat.”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ less than murder will git me up in that hall,” says I.
“Right now I’m filled with the milk of human kindness, but don’t agitate
me. All I crave is to be left alone.”</p>

<p>Well, they both talked with me plenty, and like a fool I let ’em lead
me uptown. I don’t know what they want of me, but what chance have I got
against two men, both bigger ’n I am, and three guns? If Wick Smith,
sober, fell down and busted his collarbone, what’ll happen to me?
Gravity is somethin’ I ain’t never found out how to defy, and if there’s
any rubber in my system, it shore crawls to the upper side every time I
fall off anythin’. I pleads a plenty, but it falls on deaf ears; so I
resigns myself to fate, reservin’ the right to kill both of ’em as soon
as I git around to an even break.</p>

<p>They leads me up to the Mint Hall, where everybody in the world is
congregated, and takes me around to the rear of the big platform, across
the front of which is stretched a big black curtain. They’ve shore cut a
big hole in the side of the wall to git that autymobile through, and
there she sets on a couple saw horses and some heavy planks. They’ve got
the old hall decorated with green branches, and the orchestra is already
murderin’ “Sweet Marie”, playin’ it in jig time. After while they’ll
play it for a march, play it for the openin’ hymn, and then change the
time for the first waltz. I looks over the assemblage with fear and
tremblin’. There ain’t a paid murderer in the whole gang&mdash; They do
their stuff for nothin’.</p>

<p>“Thank Gawd, there ain’t no Piperocker ownin’ any tickets on that
raffle,” says Magpie. “If Paradise or Yaller Horse don’t win that
autymobile, it’s ’cause they’ve lost the right ticket.”</p>

<p>I reckon Dirty Shirt has told Magpie about me losin’ mine in that
poker game&mdash;that is, all except one. I’m wonderin’ if they know the
money is to be used to uplift Piperock. Prob’ly not. There ain’t no
church in Paradise or Yaller Horse, and if they thought for a minute
that Piperock was goin’ to have somethin’ they ain’t got, they’d never
bought them chances.</p>

<p>We climbed in at the back of that big platform, and I fell over a
ladder. There was more danged carpenter stuff around, and it seemed as
though most everybody in Piperock was in there.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m glad you came, Ike,” says Mrs. Smith. “Poor Wickie had a
ter’ble fall.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do fine in his place,” says Mrs. Dugout Dulin, who is six
feet six inches tall, and will weigh about a hundred and ten. They ain’t
got no bathtub in their house&mdash;they use a shotgun barrel.</p>

<p>I’m too full of Christmas cheer to pay much attention, and like a
fool I let ’em dress me in a buffalo robe coat, string me with sleigh
bells, and try to tell me all about it at the same time.</p>

<p>“No time to rehearse,” pants Magpie, cinchin’ up my belt. “Anyway,
you’ll know what to do, Ike. That’s fine! Where’s the whiskers?”</p>

<p>There’s an apparition holdin’ the lantern, and it gradually dawns on
me that this is Dirty Shirt. He’s got a white cloth wound around his
head, and his figure is draped with one of Mrs. Smith’s front room
curtains. And there’s old Tellurium Woods, naked to the waist, with a
homemade horsehair wig on his bald head. From his waistline to his boot
tops he’s wearin’ a Navaho rug. I begin to see things a little plainer,
and my eyes focus on somethin’ that’s hangin’ from the ceilin’.</p>

<p>“Whazzat?” I asks.</p>

<p>“That,” says Dirty Shirt, “is the star of&mdash;of&mdash;where was
it, Tellurium?”</p>

<p>“I dunno the exact location. Pete Gonyer made it for us. Iron star,
with a glass front. Put a candle in her, and she looks like
somethin’.”</p>

<p>They started to tell me more about it, but jist about that time
Magpie and Scenery hooks some sort of a doodad around my chin, ties it
off tight in a few places, and I looks down at about three feet of chin
whiskers. They kinda shoot out from jist below my lower lip like a
waterfall, and they shore smell awful horsey.</p>

<p>“There!” says Magpie. “You look more like Santa Claus than Wick
did.”</p>

<p>I try to say somethin’, but I’m whisker bound. I talk through my
nose, but I can’t even understand what I’m sayin’. Magpie explains what
I’ve got to do. They’ve got a chimbley all built. It’s about ten feet
tall, and about three feet square. At the bottom is what looks kinda
like a fireplace.</p>

<p>“Here’s your chore,” says Magpie. “You climb that ladder to the top
of the chimbley. There’s a ladder built inside for you to come down.
Your act is the last on the bill. Up to that time, your chimbley is part
of the stable. When we git everythin’ cleared after the next to the last
act, we make this up to look like a room in the house. Mrs. Smith will
recite a poem entitled ‘It Was The Night Before Christmas’, and while
she’s recitin’, you come down the chimbley. There’ll be a Christmas
tree, and you’ll have some doojinguses to hang on it, while she speaks.
And that’s about all. We aims to show the folks jist why Christmas
started; <i>sabe</i>? Linda show the modern way of celebratin’, jist
as a&mdash;a extra act, as you might say. Mebbe you better git up there
jist before the show starts; so as to be all set. Now, I’ve got to see
that the raffle is all pulled off right.”</p>

<p>I got up out of that chair, kinda gropin’ in the dark. I wanted to
git that horse’s tail off my chin, so I could talk a little, but that
heavy coat and all them sets of sleigh bells prevents me from liftin’ my
arms. I’m jinglin’ around, grabbin’ for somethin’ or somebody to support
me, when all to once, somethin’ grabbed me by the whiskers and gave an
awful yank.</p>

<p>It knocked my feet from under me, but I didn’t fall down, ’cause I
was still suspended by the whiskers, and I looked up at the flarin’ nose
of Araby, the Scenery Sims camel. The damn’ thing has got me by the
whiskers, kinda holdin’ me up at arm’s length, as it were. And then the
blamed thing began to swing me around. My neck is jist about to break,
when all to once the toggle busts, and I went end over end out through
the black curtain, hit the edge of the platform on the seat of my pants,
where I ricocheted straight out and landed with both legs around Bill
Thatcher’s neck.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of yellin’, but it don’t mean much to me and Bill and
his bull fiddle. Willin’ hands separated us, and somebody hauled me back
onto the platform, where they yanked me back behind the curtain.</p>

<p>“I’m through Santa Clausin’,” says I. “No damn’ camel is goin’ to use
me for a sling shot.”</p>

<p>“Swaller your gorge,” says Magpie. “You ain’t hurt.”</p>

<p>“You take that camel home, or I won’t play with you.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to have that camel, Ike.”</p>

<p>There’s so much yellin’ out in front that you can’t hear
anythin’.</p>

<p>“C’mon with that raffle!”</p>

<p>“Throw Ike out again!”</p>

<p>“Start your show, before we freeze to death!”</p>

<p>Old Judge Steele and Old Testament Tilton went out on the platform.
The judge has a sawed off shotgun and Testament has a Bible.</p>

<p>“Peace!” says Testament, holdin’ up his right hand.</p>

<p>“Or-r-rder in the house!” snaps the judge, and cocks both
barrels.</p>

<p>“We’ll open with a prayer,” says Testament.</p>

<p>“Show your openers,” snorts Tombstone Todd. “And what’s a lot more,
we never came up here to listen to prayers. If you’ve got any prayers to
offer, go behind that curtain and offer ’em to Piperock. Ain’t that
right, folks?”</p>

<p>“Yea verily,” says Dog Rib Davidson, of Yaller Horse, standin’ up.
“I’d like to say a few words. I’ve got ten tickets on that
raffle&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ve got eighty!” snaps Tombstone. “Set down, Dog Rib. I’ve done
promised Mrs. Todd that autymobile.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got a lot of nerve,” growls Hank Padden. “Better wait’ll you
win it.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Magpie went out on the platform. He’s got a basket with all the
numbers in it.</p>

<p>“We’ll pull off the raffle, Testament,” he says. “No use prayin’ to
or for that bunch of horsethieves. No use wastin’ your breath, ’cause
the Lord would discount anythin’ you could say good about ’em,
anyway.</p>

<p>“I’ve got all the numbers in this basket, folks. I’ll select somebody
to draw a number, which will designate the winner. Judge, will you do
the drawin’?”</p>

<p>“Not for mine, he don’t!” yelps Tombstone. “Not for mine. You’ve got
to deal off the top of the deck to us this time, Magpie. I suggests that
my wife draw the number.”</p>

<p>That seemed to suit everybody; so Mrs. Todd waddled up and drew out a
number.</p>

<p>It was number eighteen, and you never seen such a scramble to look
over tickets. One after another, I hear ’em cussin’ their luck.
Tombstone and his wife are talkin’ their numbers out loud, and they
ain’t hittin’ nowhere near the right number. The room is kinda still
after the countin’ is all done, and when Testament clears his throat, it
sounds like somebody tearin’ a horse blanket.</p>

<p>“Who has the lucky number?” he asks. “Who has eighteen?”</p>

<p>Nobody speaks, and I suddenly realize that I’ve got that number in my
pocket. It’s the one I couldn’t find when I was in that poker game. I
manage to unhook that big coat, and I got the ticket out. It’s number
eighteen.</p>

<p>I stepped out on the platform and handed it to Testament, who squints
at it over his glasses.</p>

<p>“Ike Harper wins,” he says.</p>

<p>The crowd is kinda dumb over it all. Magpie grabs me by the arm and
hustles me back through the curtain.</p>

<p>“I’ve won me a horseless carriage,” says I. “One ticket was all I
had.”</p>

<p>“Jist enough to start a killin’,” says Magpie. “Why didn’t you keep
that ticket out of sight. Now, they’ll swear it was a brace game, and
instead of peace on earth, it’ll be pieces of Piperock scattered over
the earth. Scenery, git Testament off the platform, and let’s start the
show before they git time to start anythin’. Ike, you danged fool, we
swore to Paradise that there wasn’t a ticket held in Piperock. That’s
why they spent all their money. Somebody git that quartette to sing.
Dirty Shirt, you do it. Tell Muley Bowles to start it. Where’s your
whiskers, Ike?”</p>

<p>“The camel done et ’em.”</p>

<p>“Hell! Well, you’ll have to be Santa Claus without the whiskers. No
way out of it now. Somebody light the star, will you, Scenery. Will you
git Araby set for this scene? Everybody clear off the stage, except
Araby and the Three Wise Men. There they go!”</p>

<p>“Ho-oh-lee-e-e-e ni-i-i-i-ight,” wails the quartette.</p>

<p><em>Blunk!</em></p>

<p>“Si-eye-lent ni-i-i-i-ight,” wails the trio.</p>

<p><em>Whap!</em></p>

<p>“In the good old sum-mer-r-r-r ti-i-ime,” sings the duet, and then
quits.</p>

<p>“Who hit Telescope and Henry Peck?” asks Muley, who sings tenor.</p>

<p>Comes the click of a gun, and then Tombstone Todd’s voice:</p>

<p>“I did! Whatcha goin’ to do about it, you hunk of leaf lard?”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to do the best I can without ’em, Tombstone.”</p>

<p>“That’s the spirit,” says Judge Steele. “And I want to warn all of
you; this gun scatters pretty bad at fifty feet, but as far as that’s
concerned, I don’t expect to hit any <em>innocent</em> folks, no matter
who I shoot at.”</p>

<p>“We’ve been lied to,” wails Dog Rib. “They told me that nobody in
Piperock owned any chances. I tell you, we’ve been gypped. It don’t
stand to reason that one lone ticket&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’tcha worry, Dog Rib,” says Tombstone. “This ain’t over yet. The
Todd fambly never quits! I had eighty tickets, and any old time I spend
eighty dollars, I hang around pretty close.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t got no more right to it than I have. Numbers
don’t&mdash;”</p>

<hr>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, the show is about to begin,” says the judge.
“As far as Piperock is concerned, the raffle was on the square, and Ike
Harper wins.”</p>

<p>Old Testament steps outside the curtain.</p>

<p>“The first scene,” says he, “is the Three Wise Men in the desert.
They see the star of Bethlehem, which is brighter than all the stars. It
is so bright that it leads them on. And so they arise and foller the
star.”</p>

<p>“Do they ever ketch it?” asks somebody.</p>

<p>But jist then the curtain is drawed back, showing Magpie Simpkins,
Tellurium Woods and Dirty Shirt Jones standin’ in single file, with
Araby back of ’em. And there’s the iron star, with the candle inside it,
hanging up in front of a black cloth.</p>

<p>“And the Wise Men saw the star,” says Old Testament piously. “And
they&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>Um-m-m-m-m&mdash;a-a-a-a-ahhhh-oo-o-o-o&mdash;o-a-a-a-ah!</i>”
grunts Araby.</p>

<p>“And they looked and were much amazed, and they&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>Hoo-o-o-o-o-a-a-a-a-aw-w-w-w-oo-o-o-o-o-a-a-a-ah!</i>”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you moth-eaten, hump-backed old bum!” snorts Dirty
Shirt.</p>

<p>“<i>A-a-a-a-a-a-ah-a-a-a-a-a-aw-hoo-o-o-o-o-oah!</i>”</p>

<p>Araby’s voice was almost a wail now. I feel shore that he ate and
swallered my whiskers, and it’s done give him a bellyache.</p>

<p>“And they were much amazed,” repeated Testament, tryin’ to make
himself heard.</p>

<p>“<i>Wah-hoo-o-o-o-o-o!</i>” wails Araby.</p>

<p>“They shore sound amazed!” yells somebody in the audience.</p>

<p>“Who in hell said I didn’t win?” yells Tombstone. “That wasn’t
eighteen at all&mdash;it was eighty-one. I’ve got her right here, boys.
My wife’s drawed my number! Here she is! By grab, I win that prize!
Yah-hoo-o-o-o-o-o! Ike Harper never won nothin’, the bow-legged
sheepherder!”</p>

<p>Well, I never let none of that gang call me names, even when I’m
sober; so I steps right out on that platform, with all my bells ringin’,
and I grabbed the shotgun out of the judge’s hands.</p>

<p>“Who’s a bow-legged sheepherder, you cross between a tarantler and a
polecat?” I yelps.</p>

<p>The only light in the place is that big iron star; and that’s behind
me, so I didn’t know where to shoot&mdash;but they did.</p>

<p><em>Wham!</em> A bullet fanned my ear, and down came the
star&mdash;<em>ker-plank</em>!</p>

<p>I ducked down and rolled in behind a corner of the curtain.</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” says an awed voice in the audience. “You shot his head
off, Tombstone; I heard it hit the floor!”</p>

<p>Somebody yanked the curtains, and they began turnin’ on the lamps.
Magpie took the shotgun away from me and shoved me into a corner.</p>

<p>“This is one of the best shows I ever did see,” declares Hair Oil
Heppner. “Two singers done got knocked out, one bull fiddle busted, and
a Piperocker minus his head&mdash;and this is only the first act.”</p>

<p>“I’ve won that prize,” declared Tombstone. “Jist somebody try to stop
me from claimin’ it. Eighty-one wins.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got ten tickets,” says Dog Rib. “If eighteen was the number,
I’ve got as much right to have it as you have, Tombstone. I’m from
Yaller Horse the same as you and I&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’re <em>from</em> Yaller Horse,” admits Tombstone, “but if you
don’t shut up, you won’t never go back there, Dog Rib.”</p>

<p>Dog Rib is settin’ right behind Tombstone. Comes a dull thud, a sort
of a scramblin’ noise, and then Mrs. Todd’s voice:</p>

<p>“Git up and take to him, Tombstone. Git up, can’tcha? He hit you with
a boot. Did he hurt you, honey?”</p>

<p>“Honey’s in the comb,” says Hair Oil. “You shore do lift and drop a
wicked boot, Dog Rib. But you ort to have removed the spur. Common
etikette will tell you that it ain’t ethical to pet a man over the head
with a loose boot and not remove the spur first. I’ll betcha he’ll part
his hair in the middle for a long time to come. Well, the show gits
better as we go along, don’t it, folks?”</p>

<p>“The danged murderer’s got some of Tombstone’s tickets!” wails Mrs.
Todd.</p>

<p>“You had that boot off all the time, didn’t you?” asked Hank
Padden.</p>

<p>“Shore did. How’d you know it?”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t appreciate my reply, ’cause you live with ’em all the
time. Well, let’s go on with the show. What’s holdin’ us back? I paid
four bits to see a show, and all I’ve seen yet is small arguments. If
all we’re goin’ to do is fight&mdash;let’s build up a good one, and then
go home.” Magpie hauled me off the floor and led me back, where they’re
fixin’ up that stable scene.</p>

<p>“They’re about to do battle out there,” says I.</p>

<p>“That’s fine. If they fight among themselves, they won’t have time to
start trouble with us. Climb right up the ladder, Ike. I’ll tell you
when to come down, but it won’t be until the next act.”</p>

<hr>

<p>I started to climb up the ladder, when all at once I seen the rear
end of an old red steer below me. The lower part of my chimbley is fixed
up like a stall, and they’ve got a mean lookin’ old steer, with jist his
head showin’. The rear end is in the clear, but his head is locked
tight. On the other side of the scene is that danged whisker eatin’
camel, also caught by the head. They’ve got lanterns to light this
scene. I’m pretty sore and stiff, but I climbs up my ladder and sets
down on the edge of my chimbley. Anyway, I’m too high up for anybody to
bother me, which ain’t such a bad position, but I didn’t realize that I
stuck up above the top of the curtain.</p>

<p>Out in front, they’re still quarrelin’, but I ain’t interested. I’ve
made up my mind to buy Dog Rib a drink for hittin’ Tombstone Todd. That
old steer kinda starts weavin’ back and forth, tryin’ to git his head
out, and I’m doin’ a balancin’ act on the top of that chimbley.</p>

<p>“You better calm that cow down there,” says I. “I’m no damn’
canary.”</p>

<p>“So-o-o-o, boss,” says Magpie. “Somebody git behind that damn’ steer
with a hunk of two-by-four, will you? Go out and explain this part of
the show to them ignorant sheepherders, will you, Testament. They won’t
know what it’s all about, unless you diagram it for ’em.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead with your prep’rations,” says Dugout Dulin. “I’ll calm this
steer. Whoa, you bald-faced hunk of rawhide. Stop weavin’ or I’ll knock
your rear end out of line with your ears. How’re you comin’, Ike?”</p>

<p>“Feet first, if I have m’ choice,” says I, hangin’ on tight.</p>

<p>Testament Tilton’s voice comes to my ears, and he’s shore exortin’
somethin’ about somebody bein’ born in a manger, and the wise men
bringin’ gifts.</p>

<p>“That part of it’s all right,” says Mrs. Todd, “but that don’t help
Tombstone none. He’s done recited all his mul-pi-cation tables, and that
damn’ Dog Rib Davidson done stole over half of his tickets. Ain’t there
no law in this place? I’ve been a lady all through these proceeding, but
I’m shore goin’ to forget m’ bringin’ up. Git up, honey, and poke him in
the nose.”</p>

<p>“Little mul-pi-cation won’t hurt him none,” says Dog Rib. “He don’t
know eighteen from eighty-one. He may be honey to you, but he’s shore
horseradish to me, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“There ain’t no law against hittin’ a man with a boot, is there,
Judge?” asks Hair Oil.</p>

<p>“Not specific, Hair Oil. It may be a breach of etikette.”</p>

<p>“When he wakes up, he’ll kill somebody,” says Mrs. Todd.</p>

<p>“Not with his own gun,” chuckles Dog Rib, “ ’cause I’ve got it.”</p>

<p>“He’ll run you out of Yaller Horse, you sneakin’ thief.”</p>

<p>“Tootms two is eight,” says Tombstone. “Tootms three
is&mdash;is&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Eighteen,” says Dog Rib. “Let’s go ahead with the show.”</p>

<p>“I came out here to explain the scene to you,” says Testament.
“Unless you understand what it all means, you won’t know what it’s
about. In this scene, we aim to depict and duplicate a scene&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What happened to me?” chirps Tombstone, holdin’ his head in both
hands. “Where’d all this blood come from? I crave to know who hit me,
that’s what I’d crave?”</p>

<p>“Dog Rib hit you, honey,” says Mrs. Todd. “He stole your tickets and
your gun.”</p>

<p>“I’ll git your ears for this, Dog Rib!”</p>

<p>“You’ll need ’em to replace the ones I got from you. While you’re at
it, you might as well stock up on other parts of m’ anatomy, ’cause when
I’m through with you, you’ll need plenty fixin’, Tombstone.”</p>

<p>“Did he git number eighty-one?” asks Tombstone of his wife.</p>

<p>“If I didn’t, I’m shore cockeyed,” laughs Dog Rib. “Folks, I’ve shore
pulled the fangs out of this old sidewinder. He’s bossed Yaller Horse
jist as long as he’s goin’ to. From now on, Dog Rib Davidson
is&mdash;</p>

<p>Dog Rib is standin’ up to make his proclamation, when Telescope
Tolliver, barytone of the Cross J quartette, flung a chair halfway
across the room at Tombstone, and hit Dog Rib right on the head. Dog Rib
shudders, folds up like a hat rack and disappears behind Tombstone
Todd’s chair.</p>

<p>“Si-eye-lent ni-i-i-i-ight,” sings Telescope, startin’ in where he
left off when Tombstone knocked him out.</p>

<p>“Set down!” snorts Muley Bowles. “We’re three murders and a homicide
past that song, Telescope. Set down, before somebody kills you. This
here peace on earth stuff means to keep down and protect your own
head.”</p>

<p>“And Tombstone Todd still bosses Yaller Horse,” grunts Tombstone, as
he helps himself to Dog Rib’s gun and his own, while Mrs. Todd recovers
most of the tickets.</p>

<p>I can see and hear all this from my perch on top of the chimbley,
where I’m swayin’ like a jaybird on a limb.</p>

<p>“Git ready to yank the curtain,” says Magpie. “Put all them lanterns
inside the manger. Makes it look better. Somebody blow out the lights
out in front.”</p>

<p>“Somebody calm this here bo-veen, will you?” I asks. “I’m gittin’
seasick.”</p>

<hr>

<p>I see the lights go out over the audience, and then I hears the
curtain go rattlin’ back. Every bit of light from all them lanterns is
reflected upward, and there I set on that swayin’ chimbley top, like an
illuminated buffalo coat, decorated with brass sleigh bells, which are
jinglin’ every time that restless steer weaves back and forth.</p>

<p>I’m gittin’ so dizzy I can’t look down, and the rest of the world is
all black to me.</p>

<p>“It’s Ike Harper,” says a voice out in the crowd. “The catspaw of
Piperock!”</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot, Tombstone! You might be mistaken!”</p>

<p>“I’d know him among a million. Don’t jiggle m’ arm.”</p>

<p>“Stand still, you bald-faced <i>oreano</i>!” yelps Dugout Dulin,
and then I hears the splat of that two-by-four across the rear end of
the old steer. <em>Wham!</em></p>

<p>That bullet picked off one of my numerous sleigh bells and sent her
jinglin’ up among the rafters, and I let loose with both hands. It
wasn’t quite the longest fall I ever had, and I lit sittin’ down, for
the simple reason that the chimbley kept me from turnin’ over.</p>

<p>But I didn’t reach the floor. That old steer’s withers was between me
and <i>terry firmy</i>, as you might say, and I lit a-straddle of ’em.
I reckon I lit jist ahead of Dugout’s next attempt to pacify the steer
from behind, and we was both goin’ ahead at the impact.</p>

<p>My nose and chin knocked the front out of that fireplace, and we came
right out into that manger. I seen one horn of that steer hook into
Dirty Shirt’s curtain, and he seemed to kinda open up, like a newspaper
in the wind. It must have scared Araby, ’cause in what short time I had,
I seen that old camel’s shoulders and hump comin’ out through the wall,
and the camel’s mouth was wide open in a perfect “O”, like somebody
tryin’ to blow smoke rings.</p>

<p>“Hook’m, cow!” screams somebody out in that dark audience, and that
steer starts sunfishin’ right across that platform, headin’ for the
audience, head down, tail up, and foghorn blowin’, while behind us comes
Araby, kickin’ at everythin’ in sight, but follerin’ me and the
bald-faced steer.</p>

<p>It’s about eight feet drop to the floor off that platform, and I’ve
got both knees locked right behind that steer’s horns, when the fall
started. I gets a flash of Paradise and Yaller Horse and Piperock, goin’
backwards over their seats in the dark, and then we landed.</p>

<p>It shore was one awful jolt, but you can’t discount the Harper
fambly, when it comes to bulldoggin’ a steer. I took that animile to the
floor in one blaze of glory, as you might say. There’s only a few shots
fired. There was two fired close to the ceilin’, and I think it’s Judge
Steele up there with his shotgun, judgin’ from the sound of it. He was
right in the path of Araby the last I seen of him.</p>

<p>I’m pretty much shook to pieces, but I still retain my fightin’
instinct, and I got that steer by the horns, holdin’ his head close to
the floor. We knocked over all the chairs in reach, both of us growin’
weaker and weaker as the battle progressed.</p>

<p>Finally the steer said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, damn you, hold my arms, but git your hair out of my
mouth!”</p>

<p>There’s a light comin’ from somewhere, and I lifts my head to look
down at the face of Dog Rib Davidson. One end of his mustache points up
and the other points down, one eye swellin’ shut and there’s hair
between his teeth.</p>

<p>The light stops beside us, and I look up at Dirty Shirt Jones,
packin’ a lantern. Behind him trails that colored curtain, and that’s
about all the raiment he’s got. He looks us over by the light of the
lantern.</p>

<p>“Who’re you?” asks Dog Rib.</p>

<p>Dirty opens his mouth several times before he says:</p>

<p>“I’m one of the Wise Men who follered a star&mdash;but I lost the
damn’ thing.”</p>

<p>“Huntin’ for it with a lantern?” I asks.</p>

<p>“I ’member you,” says he, his left eye doin’ a few loops. “You’re the
feller who had ticket number eighteen, but I don’t ’member your name,
feller.”</p>

<p>“I’m Sandy Claus.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yea-a-a-a-ah!” snorts a voice, and I set up to see Tombstone and
his wife. He’s got both arms braced against her to keep her upright.
She’s got the seat of a chair balanced on her head, and her mouth is all
puckered up in a silly smile.</p>

<p>“Look out for that steer!” yelps somebody, and here comes the danged
animal, wild eyed, with a chair hangin’ to one horn. I reckon he got
hung up on somethin’ around behind the platform, and jist got loose.</p>

<p>But that steer ain’t mad; he’s scared stiff. He throws up his head
like a deer, bawls like a slide trombone, and comes right straight for
me, kickin’ busted chairs every direction. Tombstone Todd let loose of
his wife and jumped out of the way, and the steer hurdled her. I fell
sidewise, as the steer surged past, and grabbed holt of its long
tail.</p>

<p>Never do that. I went up in the air, sheddin’ busted chairs, got a
flash of that shiny autymobile in the lantern light, and then my head
hit somethin’ so hard that all the big and little stars clustered around
me. It shore was worth seein’, but it got monotonous after awhile.</p>

<p>Suddenly I hears voices, and all them stars went zippin’ away.</p>

<p>“Put her feet in, dang you! No, I want her all in. I tell you I’m
goin’ to take away what I own. Now, you show me how to start her, Dirty
Shirt.”</p>

<p>I raised up and looked around. I’m in the back seat of that danged
machine, along with Mrs. Tombstone Todd, and in the front seat is
Tombstone, with a six-gun in his right hand. I can’t see Dirty Shirt
Jones, but I can see the light of his lantern. Mrs. Todd is sprawled
out, snoring lustily.</p>

<p>“Y&mdash;you&mdash;tut&mdash;turn that dud-dingus on that dashboard,”
sayd Dirty weak-like.</p>

<p><i>Zee-e-e-e-e!</i> Somethin’ kinda hummed a little.</p>

<p>Mrs. Todd jerked upright, surged ahead and grabbed the back of the
front seat.</p>

<p>“My Gawd, I’ve had a nightmare!” says she.</p>

<p>Well, that sudden surge shoved that machine ahead, and it headed
right down them two planks. It hit the floor and headed right for the
openin’ at the head of the stairs, with Tombstone Todd kickin’ at every
pedal with his feet and yankin’ at every lever with both hands.</p>

<p>“Whoa, you locoed son of a tin-can!” he yelped.</p>

<p><i>Wham! Bam! Rer-r-r-r-r-r-ro-o-o-o-o-o-w!</i></p>

<p>I felt that machine jerk ahead like a buckin’ horse, and that dark
room was filled with lightnin’ flashes, a cloud of smoke and the noise
of a machine gun. I tried to jump out at the head of the stairs, but I
hit against the side of the opening, and got knocked back on top of Mrs.
Todd, who is yellin’ for Tombstone to let her out.</p>

<p>We shot off the top of them stairs in the dark and I don’t reckon we
ever touched again until we shot out through that doorway, over the
board sidewalk, bounced a couple times in that icy street, made a slight
right hand turn jist in time to take every post out from under Buck
Masterson’s porch. The street is full of screamin’ people, horses
runnin’ away, porch posts goin’ up and comin’ down.</p>

<p>That’s when I lost Tombstone and his wife. The machine whirled
around, kinda actin’ bowlegged, righted itself, and about that time it
must have hit somebody, ’cause I’m enveloped in a suit of clothes that’s
got somebody inside ’em, and all them little stars came back to play
with little Ikie Harper.</p>

<p>I’m conscious of a dull crash, and then perfect peace. I open my
eyes, but all is darkness. I can hear somebody movin’ around, but I’m
not much interested. Then a lamp is lit and I look around. I’m settin’
in what’s left of that prize machine, and behind me is a wrecked
doorway. I look around, and there’s Testament Tilton, standin’ beside
his pulpit, without hardly enough clothes on to flag a handcar. One eye
is swelled shut and his nose looks like a pickled beet.</p>

<p>“We’ll open services with a prayer,” says he solemn-like. “After that
I shall endeavor to explain the different scenes of our entertainment.
This is Christmas Eve&mdash;the evening when peace on earth, good will
to men predominates; the evenin’ when all men are meek and mild, and a
little child shall lead them.”</p>

<hr>

<p>I dunno how I got out of there. That busted doorway wasn’t quite big
enough, ’cause both of my legs had different ideas of direction. I’m
still wearin’ part of that buffalo coat, and a long string of sleigh
bells trail along behind me.</p>

<p>I didn’t go uptown. There wasn’t anythin’ up there to interest me; so
I cut across to my own shack. I found Dirty Shirt, Scenery Sims and
Magpie there, and they’re a fine lookin’ lot of undertaker bait.</p>

<p>I just comes jinglin’ in and rubs my hands over the fire. Magpie look
sad-like at me, but don’t say anythin’.</p>

<p>“The steer broke its neck,” says Dirty Shirt. “Jumped through a
winder and landed on its head.”</p>

<p>“Araby died in convulsions,” says Scenery.</p>

<p>“And the autymobile went to church,” says I.</p>

<p>“Anyway, we’re all alive,” remarks Magpie.</p>

<p>“Nobody but a damn’ optimist would say a thing like that,” says I. “I
hope you’re satisfied, Magpie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shore. It accomplished what we set out to do. We’ll have a new
church and a bell in the steeple.”</p>

<p>I helped myself to their jug, bent myself in the shape of a chair and
sat down by the fire.</p>

<p>“Dirty Shirt,” says I, “jist why did you and Scenery start this
movement for a new church? It’s a cinch neither of you got religion.</p>

<p>“Self-p’tection,” says Dirty. “That church looked like a saloon. Me
and Scenery got drunk and got in there by mistake.”</p>

<p>“Ter’ble,” says Scenery. “Ter’ble mishtake. Won’t happen ’gain,
y’betcha. Goin’ to have a steeple and a bell; so she’ll look and shound
like that she is. Well, here’s Merry Christmas to all and peace on
earth.”</p>

<p>I didn’t have no gun, and my fists don’t seem to be mates; so I took
another drink and went huntin’ for the horse liniment, as usual.</p>
